# Data-wrangling
Combine multiple CSVs (e.g., 100+ species) from multiple paths (e.g., 40+ folders) and export them as a single CSV for each species. Particularly useful if you are working with datasets from multiple sources and you want to combine and prepare a species detection/nondetection matrix.
